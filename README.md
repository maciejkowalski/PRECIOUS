###3 Ways to Actually Change Your Life, According to a Researcher from Stanford

BJ Fogg, PhD is the Director of the Persuasive Tech Lab at Stanford University. According to him:

> Let me explain . . . I’ve studied human behavior for 20 years, mostly at Stanford University. Here’s what I’ve learned: Only three things will change behavior in the long term.

> Option A. Have an epiphany
> Option B. Change your environment (what surrounds you)
> Option C. Take baby steps

**A. Have a Massive Teaching Moment**

Chances are if you've already had Option A you wouldn't be posting on Quora. In other words, let's not bet on it.

####B. Surround Yourself with People You Want to Be Like

Think of Option B as using reverse peer pressure on yourself.
The Longevity Project, which studied over 1000 people from youth to death had this to say:
> The groups you associate with often determine the type of person you become. For people who want improved health, association with other healthy people is usually the strongest and most direct path of change.

####C. Take Small Steps

This is probably not what you want to hear in a question about radical change, but if having a massive change of heart moment or changing your social circle aren't options, then taking tiny steps has been proven to work.

Google BJ Fogg and ‘Tiny Habits’ to learn more about how to create lasting change over time by doing small things.

####Focus on What You Want and Get Rewarded for Making Change

Research has also shown that focusing on what we want instead of what we don't want makes it more likely that we'll get it. Focusing on what you want also makes you more optimistic, and positivity actually increases productivity and increases your chances for success.

**Your question focuses a lot on what you don't want, not what you do. Reverse that, get more clear on what you do want to happen, and focus more on that.**

We're also kind of like puppies, in that human beings respond very well to positive reinforcement. When you want to make changes in your life, make sure you reward yourself when you actually do those changes, just like you'd train a puppy.

If you want to train a puppy to sit, you don't tell him to not stand. You wouldn't scold him whenever he stood up. You'd just tell him to sit, and when he sits, you reward him. Change yourself the same way.


####TL;DR:
####1. Surround Yourself with People You Want to Be Like
####2. Take Small Steps
####3. Focus on What You Want
####4. Reward Yourself for Making Small Changes
