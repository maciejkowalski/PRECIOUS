BJ Fogg, PhD is the Director of the Persuasive Tech Lab at Stanford University. According to him:

> Let me explain . . . I’ve studied human behavior for 20 years, mostly at Stanford University. Here’s what I’ve learned: Only three things will change behavior in the long term.

> Option A. Have an epiphany
> Option B. Change your environment (what surrounds you)
> Option C. Take baby steps

Chances are if you've already had Option A you wouldn't be posting on Quora. In other words, let's not bet on it.

Think of Option B as using reverse peer pressure on yourself.

> The groups you associate with often determine the type of person you become. For people who want improved health, association with other healthy people is usually the strongest and most direct path of change.

**C. Take Small Steps**
